# Usage
You can just start the app [here](https://muepatrick.github.io/joey-triviani/).

# Technical Background
I just needed something to entertain me for one or two days. So I decided to try out AngularJS. On an other topic a friend recommended to take a look at the Open Trivia Database. That was all.

Whenever I get some more motivation I may add some way to keep track of points.

Also I will use this to get familiar with GitHub Pages.

# To build it
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` (to host a live version)
3. `npm run build` (to build a hostable version)

This app is made possible by the awesome <strong><a href="https://opentdb.com">Open Trivia Database</a></strong> as they provide all their content under the "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License" license and have a very easy to use API where I request all the questions.

As with most of my projects I used <strong><a href="https://bulma.io">Bulma</a></strong> as my CSS framework (provided under the "MIT" license). (Yes, I know I somehow broke the dropdown menues but I am too lazy to fix them.)
